# Portfolio

I have made this portfolio to show case all of the cool things I have been able to do in my college career, and all of the exciting events I have been able to participate in.

# About Me

I am a Sophomore Computer Science & Machine Learning Student at the University of Maryland - College Park, and I like to build random things.
